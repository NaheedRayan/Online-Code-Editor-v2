        <p>
            Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence. Her
            name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually
            be seen by her. She looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into
            working order. She was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last.
            She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power to put her in the room, but
            not the power to make her repent. It wasn't fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she
            wouldn't change her attitude. At three years old, Sandy's stubborn personality had already bloomed into full
            view.
            Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the
            same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It
            was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.
            He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were
            accurate. He couldn't be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it
            was a long time. Much too long.
            She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly. It seemed
            that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep things clean and
            orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn't know was there was a
            tiny creature living in it that didn't like things neat.
            He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone
            just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each
            and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind
            it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who
            watched in amazement.
            He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter.
            She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it.
            That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and
            smiled, saying it was excellent.
            She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted
            that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go.
            Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here
            she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.
            The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't
            hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so
            sealed his fate.
            She wondered if the note had reached him. She scolded herself for not handing it to him in person. She
            trusted her friend, but so much could happen. She waited impatiently for word.
            The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't
            appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was
            either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. The
            correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and
            didn't have a choice.
            I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one
            side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was
            startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and
            reverberated by the angry echoes.
            She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was
            something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything.
            He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most
            important. It was the next step that was the most important.
            It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. While
            everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less
            than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine
            that had passed as life until then.
            They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need. There was no
            time to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown
            into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that
            they had forgotten the most important thing of all.
            Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That's what Wendy was thinking. She
            opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn't something completely
            unheard of, it also wasn't normal. It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel
            it in her bones and it wasn't the way she wanted the day to begin.
            She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. "You need to learn to think for
            yourself," she wanted to tell him. "Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down." But she didn't
            because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never
            give them up.
            Sometimes it's simply better to ignore the haters. That's the lesson that Tom's dad had been trying to teach
            him, but Tom still couldn't let it go. He latched onto them and their hate and couldn't let it go, but he
            also realized that this wasn't healthy. That's when he came up with his devious plan.
            Sometimes that's just the way it has to be. Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn't let them
            enter his mind. It was done and that was that. It was just the way it had to be.
            Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is
            a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these
            numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that
            with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all
            manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
            She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she'd feel
            upon reaching it wasn't there. Something wasn't right. Was this the only feeling she'd have for over five
            years of hard work?
            He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in
            nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are
            actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus
            far in the 50+ years of his life.
            Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was
            hoping to experience. As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself
            in a little more than she bargained for. It wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a
            pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal.
            She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch as
            they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever
            happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?
            According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the
            American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for
            Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition
            throughout the world in all the learned professions.”
            He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. Hundreds of
            thousands? "Not enough," the said under his breath. I need more.
            "Explain to me again why I shouldn't cheat?" he asked. "All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for
            doing so. I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don't? That's what you're
            telling me?"
            There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily
            bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was
            gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land.
            Sometimes there isn't a good answer. No matter how you try to rationalize the outcome, it doesn't make
            sense. And instead of an answer, you are simply left with a question. Why?
            Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her
            whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It
            was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting
            at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry
            all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare
            insteps.
            The lone lamp post of the one-street town flickered, not quite dead but definitely on its way out. Suitcase
            by her side, she paid no heed to the light, the street or the town. A car was coming down the street and
            with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air, she had a plan.
            Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth
            of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain
            frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.
            He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite
            possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again
            tried to imagine it was the first time.
            Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no
            business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to
            explain this to the others?
            It's not his fault. I know you're going to want to, but you can't blame him. He really has no idea how it
            happened. I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found
            out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get
            her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.
            It had become a far too common an event in her life. She has specifically placed the key to the box in a
            special place so that she wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that
            she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.
            I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this
            moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is
            patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because
            it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction.
            There wasn't a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. It was the clouds. The deep
            green that isn't the color of clouds, but came with these. She knew what was coming and she hoped she was
            prepared.
            What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want
            to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life.
            Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around
            him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that
            he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be enough.
            If you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall, with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the
            braincase of a man, you'll have a rough idea of what they looked like -- except for their teeth. The canines
            would have fitted better in the face of a tiger, and showed at the corners of their wide, thin-lipped
            mouths, giving them an expression of ferocity.

            Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence. Her
            name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually

            American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for
            Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition
            throughout the world in all the learned professions.”
            He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. Hundreds of
            thousands? "Not enough," the said under his breath. I need more.
            "Explain to me again why I shouldn't cheat?" he asked. "All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for
            doing so. I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don't? That's what you're
            telling me?"
            There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily
            bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was
            gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land.
            Sometimes there isn't a good answer. No matter how you try to rationalize the outcome, it doesn't make
            sense. And instead of an answer, you are simply left with a question. Why?
            Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her
            whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It
            was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting
            at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry
            all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare
            insteps.
            The lone lamp post of the one-street town flickered, not quite dead but definitely on its way out. Suitcase
            by her side, she paid no heed to the light, the street or the town. A car was coming down the street and
            with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air, she had a plan.
            Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth
            of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain
            frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.
            He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite
            possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again
            tried to imagine it was the first time.
            Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no
            business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to
            explain this to the others?
            It's not his fault. I know you're going to want to, but you can't blame him. He really has no idea how it
            happened. I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found
            out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get
            her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.
            It had become a far too common an event in her life. She has specifically placed the key to the box in a
            special place so that she wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that
            she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.
            I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this
            moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is
            patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because
            it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction.
            There wasn't a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. It was the clouds. The deep
            green that isn't the color of clouds, but came with these. She knew what was coming and she hoped she was
            prepared.
            What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want
            to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life.
            Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around
            him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that
            he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be enough.
            If you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall, with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the
            braincase of a man, you'll have a rough idea of what they looked like -- except for their teeth. The canines
            would have fitted better in the face of a tiger, and showed at the corners of their wide, thin-lipped
            mouths, giving them an expression of ferocity.


            Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence. Her
            name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually
            be seen by her. She looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into
            working order. She was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last.
            She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power to put her in the room, but
            not the power to make her repent. It wasn't fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she
            wouldn't change her attitude. At three years old, Sandy's stubborn personality had already bloomed into full
            view.
            Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the
            same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It
            was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.
            He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were
            accurate. He couldn't be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it
            was a long time. Much too long.
            She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly. It seemed
            that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep things clean and
            orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn't know was there was a
            tiny creature living in it that didn't like things neat.
            He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone
            just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each
            and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind
            it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who
            watched in amazement.
            He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter.
            She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it.
            That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and
            smiled, saying it was excellent.
            She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted
            that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go.
            Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here
            she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.
            The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't
            hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so
            sealed his fate.
            She wondered if the note had reached him. She scolded herself for not handing it to him in person. She
            trusted her friend, but so much could happen. She waited impatiently for word.
            The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't
            appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was
            either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. The
            correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and
            didn't have a choice.
            I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one
            side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was
            startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and
            reverberated by the angry echoes.
            She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was
            something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything.
            He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most
            important. It was the next step that was the most important.
            It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. While
            everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less
            than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine
            that had passed as life until then.
            They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need. There was no
            time to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown
            into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that
            they had forgotten the most important thing of all.
            Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That's what Wendy was thinking. She
            opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn't something completely
            unheard of, it also wasn't normal. It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel
            it in her bones and it wasn't the way she wanted the day to begin.
            She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. "You need to learn to think for
            yourself," she wanted to tell him. "Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down." But she didn't
            because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never
            give them up.
            Sometimes it's simply better to ignore the haters. That's the lesson that Tom's dad had been trying to teach
            him, but Tom still couldn't let it go. He latched onto them and their hate and couldn't let it go, but he
            also realized that this wasn't healthy. That's when he came up with his devious plan.
            Sometimes that's just the way it has to be. Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn't let them
            enter his mind. It was done and that was that. It was just the way it had to be.
            Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is
            a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these
            numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that
            with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all
            manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
            She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she'd feel
            upon reaching it wasn't there. Something wasn't right. Was this the only feeling she'd have for over five
            years of hard work?
            He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in
            nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are
            actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus
            far in the 50+ years of his life.
            Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was
            hoping to experience. As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself
            in a little more than she bargained for. It wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a
            pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal.
            She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch as
            they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever
            happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?
